    how to get the player.transform without a seperate trigger?

    change the players box collider when crouching 
    but make it so they cant stand in small gaps?
        maybe just dont have any small gaps? crouch only for dodging?



    weapon special attack
    power bar when its full you can perform a special attack
    if (bar is full && left trigger held && attack button pressed)
        do special

    health potions pick up automatically and stack?
    rb to use healthe pot

    coins spew out of dead enemies like blood?

    shop (if have time)
    a break inbetween levels where you can buy

    multiple options with a coin cost benith
    if (player is standing on weapon to buy && coins >= cost)
        swap weapon with one equipped
        coins - cost

    
    packages 
    A* Pathfinding
